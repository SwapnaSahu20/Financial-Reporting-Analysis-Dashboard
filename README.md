Overview :

This dashboard is perfect for tracking Revenue, Expense, Profit, and Overall Financial Performance in a single view.

I have designed  a comprehensive financial dashboard to track Revenue, Expenses, Profit, and overall financial performance—all in a single, easy-to-understand view.

This dashboard features clean visuals, key KPIs, and interactive charts, enabling quick and effective financial analysis using Excel.

Approach using STAR Method:

Situation
The business lacked a consolidated view of financial performance, making it difficult for stakeholders to track revenue, expenses, profit trends, and department-wise performance efficiently.

Task
My responsibility was to design an interactive financial dashboard that provides a clear overview of financial performance and enables stakeholders to analyze trends, cost drivers, and profitability efficiently.

Action
Designed an end-to-end Financial Reporting & Analysis Dashboard in Excel using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, slicers, and KPIs.
Built KPIs for Total Revenue, Total Expense, Profit & Loss, Max Revenue, and Max Expense.
Created interactive visuals:

Expense by Category (Rent, Utilities, Office Supplies)

Revenue by Category (Product Sales, Subscription, Licensing)

Revenue vs Expense by Department

Monthly Profit Trend

Implemented department-wise Revenue vs Expense comparison to identify cost-heavy and high-performing departments.

Implemented slicers for Year, Month, Quarter, Department, and Payment Method to enable dynamic filtering.

Ensured clean layout, consistent color themes, and business-friendly labeling for non-technical users.

Result

Revenue vs Expense Insight: Revenue significantly exceeds expenses, resulting in strong overall profitability.
Subscriptions and Licensing contribute the highest share of revenue
IT and Finance generate high revenue but also incur significant expenses, suggesting scope for operational efficiency improvements
Identified highest revenue-generating categories and expense-heavy areas, supporting better budgeting decisions.
Reduced dependency on manual reports and improved reporting accuracy.
Improved decision-making by clearly highlighting profit trends and department-wise cost efficiency.
